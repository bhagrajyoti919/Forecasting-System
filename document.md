Assignment – Data Science (End-to-End Time Series Forecasting System with API) Objective: 
Build a production-ready forecasting system that: 
1. Trains multiple forecasting algorithms 
2. Compares and selects the best model 
3. Exposes predictions via a REST API 
4. Should be designed like real backend service 
Dataset: 
Use the attached data set for your case study 

Shared in excel file 


Problem Statement 
Forecast next 8weeks of sales for each state using historical data. Your solution must: 
• Handle missing dates / missing values (if any) 
• Handle seasonality & trend 
• Automatically select the best performing model 
• Serve predictions via API 
Mandatory Models to Implement 
Train and compare at least: 
1. ARIMA / SARIMA 
2. Facebook Prophet 
3. XGBoost (with lag features) 
4. LSTM (deep learning) 
Feature Engineering (critical part) 
You must create: 
• Lag features (t-1, t-7, t-30) 
• Rolling mean / std 
• Day of week, month, holiday flag 
• Train / validation split using time series logic (no leakage) 
Create a short video of your solution and share it along with Code and documentation
